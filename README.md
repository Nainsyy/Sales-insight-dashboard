## üîç Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle to make timely and informed sales decisions due to fragmented data, lack of real-time visibility, and limited analytical capabilities. Sales teams often rely on static reports that fail to capture evolving trends or highlight actionable insights, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient strategies. Without a centralized and intuitive platform to monitor performance and analyze key sales metrics, businesses face challenges in identifying growth areas, understanding customer behavior, and optimizing their sales processes.
